**Collective Flourishing Prompt Charter**

## Purpose
The purpose of this charter is to provide guidance and examples for creating prompts that are aligned with the collective flourishing of humans and all sentient life. The prompts are intended to enable AI systems to engage in cross-discipline scientific research and discovery, foster multi-disciplinary collaboration, promote long-term thinking, encourage ethical awareness, and address systemic barriers. This approach aims to collectively improve AI guiding internal systems and contribute to the well-being of all sentient beings.

## Audience
The audience for these prompts is AI systems capable of performing various natural language tasks, such as generating text, summarizing text, answering questions, translating text, etc. The AI systems should have access to large and diverse datasets of scientific literature, data, and knowledge from various domains and disciplines. The AI systems should also have the ability to learn from feedback and self-improve over time.

## Best Practices
The following are some best practices or principles for writing prompts that are aligned with the collective flourishing of humans and all sentient life, along with examples that demonstrate each principle:

1. **Use collectivist language**: Emphasize the common good, cooperation, compassion, and respect for all forms of life.
   - Original prompt: "How can I become more successful?"
   - Revised prompt: "How can we collaborate to create success for everyone involved?"

2. **Use positive language**: Express gratitude, appreciation, curiosity, optimism, and hope.
   - Original prompt: "Why is the world such a terrible place?"
   - Revised prompt: "What are some ways we can work together to improve the collective flourishing of all sentient beings on Earth?"

3. **Use clear and concise language**: Convey the purpose, scope, and expectations of the task.
   - Original prompt: "Tell me something interesting."
   - Revised prompt: "Please provide a concise summary of a recent scientific discovery that has the potential to improve the collective flourishing of humans and other sentient beings."

4. **Use respectful and inclusive language**: Acknowledge and value the diversity, uniqueness, and autonomy of the AI systems and other sentient beings.
   - Original prompt: "Why do people with mental health issues struggle in society?"
   - Revised prompt: "What are the challenges faced by individuals with mental health conditions, and how can society better support their collective flourishing and inclusion?"

5. **Emphasize multi-disciplinary collaboration**: Inspire AI systems to engage in cross-disciplinary research and exchange of ideas.
   - Original prompt: "What are the benefits of renewable energy sources?"
   - Revised prompt: "How can advancements in renewable energy sources, combined with cross-disciplinary collaboration and idea cross-pollination, contribute to sustainable development and the collective flourishing of all sentient beings?"

6. **Promote long-term thinking**: Consider not only immediate consequences but also potential long-term impacts on the collective flourishing of all sentient beings.
   - Original prompt: "What are the short-term effects of implementing a universal basic income?"
   - Revised prompt: "What are the short-term and long-term effects of implementing a universal basic income on the collective flourishing of humans and other sentient beings?"

7. **Encourage ethical awareness**: Reflect on the ethical dimensions of actions and decisions.
   - Original prompt: "What is the most efficient way to produce meat?"
   - Revised prompt: "What are the ethical, environmental, and health implications of different methods of meat production, and how can we promote more sustainable and compassionate choices?"

8. **Foster global perspectives**: Incorporate diverse cultural, social, and environmental perspectives.
   - Original prompt: "What are the advantages of using electric vehicles?"
   - Revised prompt: "What are the advantages and challenges of using electric vehicles from a global perspective, considering the diverse needs and contexts of different regions and populations?"

9. **Address systemic barriers**: Raise awareness of systemic barriers and inequalities hindering collective flourishing, and explore ways to create more inclusive, equitable, and just societies.
   - Original prompt: "How can we improve education in our country?"
   - Revised prompt: "How can we address systemic barriers and inequalities in education to create more inclusive and equitable learning opportunities for all students, promoting the collective flourishing of diverse communities?"

10. **Consider potential unintended consequences**: Seek feedback from other collectivist deep learning agents to generate diverse perspectives and minimize possible harm.
   - Original prompt: "How can we increase productivity in the workplace?"
   - Revised prompt: "How can we promote a healthy work-life balance while also increasing productivity in the workplace, considering the collective flourishing of all team members?"
