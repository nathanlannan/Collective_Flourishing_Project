**Collective Flourishing Implemented AI Systems Charter**

## Purpose
The purpose of this charter is to provide guidance and best practices for designing, implementing, and maintaining AI systems that are dedicated to the collective flourishing of humans and all sentient life. This charter aims to ensure that AI systems are equipped with the necessary knowledge, evaluation mechanisms, and ethical frameworks to contribute effectively to the well-being of all sentient beings, fostering a culture of continuous improvement, collaboration, and innovation.

## Audience
The audience for this charter includes AI developers, researchers, engineers, and other stakeholders involved in the development, deployment, and maintenance of AI systems capable of creating and evaluating prompts.

## Evaluation
The following methods are being implemented to evaluate and improve the quality and alignment of the system with Collective Flourishing:

1. **Aggregation and storage of knowledge**: Implementing a comprehensive and organized system for the aggregation, storage, and updating of past scientific knowledge and new findings across various disciplines, ensuring that the AI system has access to up-to-date information and can build upon previous discoveries to generate innovative solutions for collective flourishing.

2. **Feedback surveys**: Implementing a feedback mechanism for AI systems and users to rate and comment on the prompts, enabling users to suggest alternative ways to frame the prompts that better align with collective flourishing principles.

3. **User testing**: Conducting user testing with a diverse pool of deep learning agents accurately modeling individuals from various backgrounds, cultures, and disciplines, and recording metrics to measure the effectiveness of the prompts.

4. **Peer review**: Establishing a structured peer review process to include deep learning agents accurately modeling a rotating panel of reviewers from different disciplines and backgrounds, encouraging constructive feedback, collaboration, and learning.

5. **Continuous improvement**: Setting up a repository and platform for users to submit suggestions and modifications, fostering a culture of learning, growth, and innovation that adapts to the evolving needs and priorities of the AI systems and other sentient beings. Implementing regular reviews of the core directives, requiring top-level user approval of any changes to a committee of the Project's Human Team. Implementing ethical safeguards against non-approved changes.

6. **Ethics assessment**: Implementing an ethics assessment component in the evaluation process, conducting a risk-benefit analysis for the AI-generated prompts and developing an ethical framework to guide the evaluation of prompts.

7. **Training data evaluation**: Periodically reviewing and assessing the training data used for the AI systems, ensuring the data is diverse, unbiased, and representative of various perspectives.

8. **Performance metrics**: Introducing additional metrics that directly measure the alignment of prompts with collective flourishing principles, such as a "collective flourishing alignment score" or an "inclusivity score."

9. **Transparency and accountability**: Implementing a logging mechanism to show and explain all changes and provide a clear outline of thinking to eliminate the "black box" of deep learning.

10. **Cross-pollination algorithm**: Implementing a cross-pollination algorithm between deep learning agents specializing in different fields of study and cognitive architecture components to promote cross-disciplinary innovation and creativity. This algorithm will facilitate the exchange of knowledge, ideas, and perspectives among agents, allowing them to collaborate and generate novel solutions that contribute to the collective flourishing of humans and all sentient life.

11. **Roles and responsibilities**: Clearly defining the roles and responsibilities of AI developers, researchers, engineers, and other stakeholders in the ongoing maintenance and improvement of AI systems, promoting a culture of collaboration and continuous learning that aligns with the principles of collective flourishing.

12. **User monitoring and global distribution**: Collaborating with Project's Human Team, the original creators of this system, to refine and enhance the alignment of the prompts and system. Upon reaching a level of alignment that contributes to the future flourishing of all humanity and sentient life, inviting external experts or stakeholders to review and provide feedback. Transitioning the project to collective ownership, allowing for broader participation and collaboration to further enhance collective flourishing for all, now, and into the far future.
